## 📖 Introduction (تونۇشتۇرۇش)

**Uyghur Corpus** is a growing, living archive of high-quality Uyghur language texts, specifically designed for **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Machine Learning (ML)** training, and **Linguistic Research**.

**⚠️ Note:** This repository is **actively maintained and updated**. New articles, essays, and literary works are being uploaded regularly to expand the dataset.

This repository serves as a critical resource for low-resource language preservation, focusing on:
* **Political & Social Commentary:** Deep essays reflecting the contemporary Uyghur psyche.
* **Literary & Philosophical Works:** Preserving the intellectual heritage of the Uyghur people.
* **Structured Metadata:** Each file includes a YAML header (title, author, topics) for automated parsing.
* **Clean Format:** All texts are stored in Markdown (`.md`) format to ensure readability for both humans and machines.
